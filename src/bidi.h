 * Shaping is not our problem: a text run is handed to the graphics
 * backend whole, and the backend joins and orders the characters inside
 * it. What the backend cannot do is order the runs *between* themselves,
 * because MicroTeX decides where each box goes. That is what this is for.
 *
 * Only needed once a line breaks. Unwrapped text is a single run and the
 * backend orders all of it (see RowAtom::_mergeText); a wrapped
 * paragraph is one run per word, and those have to be reordered per line
 * after the breaks are chosen -- which is the order the algorithm
 * requires anyway.
 *
 * FriBidi supplies the embedding levels. It is optional: without it
 * bidi_available() is false, levels come back empty, and wrapped
 * right-to-left text keeps the left-to-right order it had before.
