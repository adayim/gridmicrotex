 * `%` as a character rather than a comment, and how `\makeatletter` makes
 * `@` part of a name. Reading ahead would have frozen the old catcodes.
 *
 * Whitespace follows TeX's three line states. A control word swallows the
 * spaces after it; a run of spaces is one space token; a line end is a
 * space; the spaces that start a line are dropped; a blank line is a
 * paragraph break (when asked for); and a `%` comment takes the line end
 * with it.
 *
 * Control-word names are ASCII letters only, plus `@` while it has the
 * letter catcode. Invalid UTF-8 becomes U+FFFD with a warning.
 *
 * Every step consumes input, so the lexer is linear in the input length.
 *
 * The lexer does not own its source: `source` and `catcodes` must outlive it.
