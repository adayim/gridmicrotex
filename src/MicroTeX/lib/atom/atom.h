 * It also defines its type, used for determining what glue to use between adjacent atoms
 * in a "row construction". That can be one single type by assigning one of the type
 * constants to the [_type] field. But they can also be defined as having two types: a
 * "left type" and a "right type". This can be done by implementing the methods
 * [leftType()] and [rightType()]. The left type will then be used for determining the
 * glue between this atom and the previous one (in a row, if any) and the right type for
 * the glue between this atom and the following one (in a row, if any).
 *
 * And the [_limitsType] used for determining what variant to use when constructing scripts,
 * defaults to [LimitsType::noLimits].
